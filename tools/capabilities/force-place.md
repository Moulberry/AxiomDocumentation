# Force Place

The **Force Place** capability bypasses normal placement restrictions.

* Blocks which normally need to be attached to solid blocks can be placed in mid air
* Blocks can be placed inside entities (including yourself)
* Plant blocks no longer need to be placed on farmland (or sand/dirt for sugarcane and clay for dripleaf)
* Blocks can be placed regardless of light level
* And many more!
