# No Updates
The **No Updates** capability ‘freezes’ blocks and adjacent blocks in their current state and prevents shape and neighbour updates when breaking or placing blocks nearby.

This is useful when working with "non-vanilla" states of stairs/fences/walls/etc. which would normally revert to their vanilla state when breaking/placing blocks near them.
