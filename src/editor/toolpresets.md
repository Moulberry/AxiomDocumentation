## Tool Presets

Tool Presets allow for easy saving and loading of tool settings and configurations. Tool presets are saved in the axiom [configuration](/advanced/configuration.md) at `.minecraft/config/axiom/tool_presets` in NBT format.

## Saving Presets

To save presets, first set the configuration of the tool you'd like to save. Clicking the plus icon next to the presets drop-down will display a text field. Here you can name the preset. After clicking save, your preset will appear in the drop-down.
