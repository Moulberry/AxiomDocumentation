# View

The View submenu lets you configure options related to viewing and rendering certain elements in the Editor Menu.

## New View

Creates a new [View](/editor/windows/views.md) located at the current position.

## Show Selection

Toggles the rendering of [Selections](/editor/selections.md).

## Show Biomes

Toggles the visualisation of biomes. Each biome is represented with its own colour.

Be aware that biomes in Minecraft are defined in a 4x4x4 grid. However, to make biomes feel more natural, vanilla warps the biomes visually. The biome overlay shows the "real" position of biomes, while biome blending and the f3 screen show the "warped" position of biomes.

The default shortcut for this view is `Ctrl+B`.

## Show Annotations
Toggles the rendering of [annotations](/tools/utility/annotation.md).

## Show Ruler
Toggles the rendering of [rulers](/tools/utility/ruler.md).
## Show Key Presses

This shows your keyboard and mouse inputs in the bottom-right corner of the screen. This can be useful for making tutorials or debugging problems.

## UI Scale

This slider ranges from 0.5 to 2. This lets you change the size of all graphical elements in the editor mode.

## Min Brightness

The 'Min Brightness' slider ranges from 0 to 1. This lets you change how dark unlit places look in your world. A value of 1 means all blocks are fully lit, this functions similar to night vision.

## Fluid Opacity

The 'Fluid Opacity' slider ranges from 0 to 1. This lets you change the opacity of water to alter its visibility. A value of 0 will result in water being invisible.

Lava and modded fluids are not affected due to performance concerns.

## Block Version
The 'Block Version' dropdown lets you set a Minecraft version to highlight blocks red in Axiom's user interface that are incompatible with the version specified. Very useful if you want to, for instance, use Axiom to build structures for 1.8 servers.
