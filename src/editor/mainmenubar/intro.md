## Tool Masks

Clear and open the tool mask editing window. See [Tool Masks](toolmasks.md)

## Window

The **Windows** submenu lets the user toggle [Windows](windows/intro.md). If you ever close a window and want it back, this submenu allows you to re-enable it. With this window, you can also save and restore a default layout.

To store a layout, pressing the 'Store Current Layout as Default' will save your current window layout. To restore the saved layout, press the 'Restore Default Layout' button. You can export and import layouts to and from your clipboard.

## Keybinds

The **Keybinds** button opens a [window](/editor/windows/keybinds.md) to edit and set keybinds for tools and operations.

## Help
    
The **Help** submenu contains useful information and configuration options.

The dropdown contains links to information and resources. The [style editor](/editor/windows/styleeditor.md) can be accessed through this window, allowing you to change and import custom colours for the Editor UI. 

> Tip: You can also use 'Skip Tutorial' from the help submenu to skip the tutorial popups if you are working with multiple minecraft instances regularly and forgot to copy [.axiominternal](/advanced/configuration.md)
