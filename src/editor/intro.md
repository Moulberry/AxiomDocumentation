# Editor Mode

The Editor Mode includes a large variety of tools and operations for large-scale world manipulation, painting, terraforming and sculpting. The Editor UI has been designed specially for this purpose, combining camera controls from conventional 3D software with powerful tools tailored for Minecraft building. The layout of the Editor UI can be customized by rearranging and docking the windows to your liking.
