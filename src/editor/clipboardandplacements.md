# Clipboard and Placements

## Clipboard

A selection can be copied to the clipboard using Ctrl+C. 

With blocks in your clipboard, you can paste back into the world by hovering over the desired location and pressing Ctrl+V. Pasting like this will initiate a **Placement** (see below).

The clipboard can be cleared by right-clicking the icon and choosing the 'clear' option. Left-clicking the clipboard opens up the [**Blueprint Browser**](blueprints.md).

## Placement

Placements can be repositioned and rotated using the [Gizmo](gizmos.md).

Once the placement is in the correct position, you can use Enter or Ctrl+V to confirm it. To cancel a placement, use the Delete key.

> Tip: The placement can be rotated clockwise using the Ctrl+R keybind, and can be flipped in the direction of your mouse vector using the Ctrl+F keybind.
