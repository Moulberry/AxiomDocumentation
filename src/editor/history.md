# History

The History window shows you an overview of how many and what operations you just performed. It serves as a visual aid to assist in performing undo (Ctrl+Z) and redo (Ctrl+Y) operations.

> Tip: You can left-click history elements to *rewind* to that point, or right-click to point your camera towards the center of the edit.
