# Text Annotations

The **Text Annotations** window can be accessed via the 'View All Text Annotations' button of the [Annotation Tool](/tools/utility/annotation.md). The window displays a list of all text annotations in the world with an index. With it you can teleport to, update, and remove text annotations from anywhere in the world.

The **Text Field** displays the current contents of the text annotation. Clicking and writing to it will change the text displayed by the annotation. 

The **Teleport (X,Y,Z)** button displays the location of the text annotation, and clicking it will teleport the player to that location.

The **Remove** button will delete the text annotation.

> Note that text annotation colour, opacity, or other formatting isn't displayed in this window.
