# Windows

**Windows** are the main part of the Editor Mode. Allowing for any layout, **Windows** are extremely versatile and customisable.

All **Windows** are built around the main [view](views.md) as it's the only window that cannot be removed.

### Opening New Windows

To open a closed window, use the [Main Menu Bar](/editor/mainmenubar/intro.md) and find the `Windows` category. In there, you will find a list of each Window and its toggle.

When enabling a window, it will appear in the centre of the screen as slightly transparent. This is due to the window being undocked.

## Window Layouts

Windows can be laid out in multiple ways on the screen. To adjust a window's position, simply drag the topmost part of the window and drag it to where you would like it to be.

> Tip: Undocked windows can be minimised by clicking the triangle next to the window title.

### Docking

To dock a window, drag the window and hover it over one of the eight blue shapes that appear. You can either dock using pre-existing windows or add a new position.

To undock a window, drag it by the title across the screen.

## Other Windows

### Themes

Themes can be used to further customise the Editor UI with custom colours. To edit the current theme, click [Style Editor](/editor/windows/styleeditor.md) under `Help` in the [Main Menu Bar](/src/editor/mainmenubar/intro.md). Themes can be imported and exported from the clipboard. 

### Select Block

The select block window is essentially the creative inventory for the Editor Mode. You can either search by block name or block ID.
