# Clipboard

A [Selection](/editor/selections.md) can be copied to the clipboard using `Ctrl+C`. 

The clipboard can be cleared, rotated and flipped by right-clicking the icon and choosing the corresponding options. 

Left-clicking the 'Empty' clipboard icon opens up the [Blueprint Browser](blueprints.md).
 

## Using the clipboard

With an item in your clipboard, you can paste it back into the world in the desired location using the mouse cursor position and pressing `Ctrl+V`. This will initiate a [Placement](/editor/placement.md).

While the [placement](/editor/placement.md) is initiated and the [Gizmo](/editor/gizmos.md) is visible, some [options](/editor/placement.md#placement-options) will appear on your main view window. Which will allow you to edit the placement before it's placed.

To confirm the placement, press `Ctrl+V` or the `Enter` key.


> Tip: You can set the Cut function save to the clipboard in the [Keybinds Menu](/editor/mainmenubar/intro.md#Keybinds).
