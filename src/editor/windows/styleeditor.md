# Style Editor

The **Style Editor** can be used to customize the appearance of [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), the UI powering editor mode.

Use the 'Base Style' dropdown to quickly change the base color of ImGui from Dark to Light Mode or vice versa.

## Custom Theme

The **Custom Theme** section of the style editor is for importing and exporting themes or resetting the current theme. The 'Theme Name' text field can be used to set the name of the theme when exporting. 

## Theme Parameter

The **Theme Parameter** section is partitioned into two sides.

The section on the left is for setting parameters, while the right section is for previewing the changes

The **Size** tab lets you customize the rendering of borders by enabling or disabling the respective checkboxes in the 'Borders' dropdown and configure corner rounding for various elements of the UI via the 'Rounding' dropdown. 

The **Color** tab allows for customizing the coloring of almost every element of the UI.
