# Views

Views are a system for keeping track of multiple named locations in your world, giving you the ability to swap between locations (even across dimensions) easily. 

A new view can be created in the [View submenu](mainmenubar.md#view) or by clicking on the ‘+’ button next to the ‘Main’ view above the game window in the Axiom Editor UI. 
 
Views will keep track of your last position and teleport you back to that location when you switch back to the view. If you want to make sure the view stays at the correct location, you can turn on *Pin World* and *Pin Location* options. Pinning the location will make it so that you always teleport back to the pinned spot when you switch to the view.

> Tip: If a location is pinned, you can teleport to the pinned location simply by clicking the view tab again, even if the tab is already selected
