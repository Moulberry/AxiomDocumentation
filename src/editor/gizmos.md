# Gizmos

Gizmos are a common UI element which allows positioning within the 3D world.

A gizmo can contain the following elements:
- **Axis Arrows** These coloured arrows correspond to the Cartesian coordinate system, otherwise known as XYZ coordinates. The red, green and blue arrows allow the gizmo to be dragged along the X, Y and Z axis respectively.
- **Center Node** The center node can be clicked and dragged to move the gizmo on all 3 axis. While dragging, the gizmo will maintain the same distance to the camera.
- **Rotation Rings** Some operations like placement or shape placement will add a rotation ring to the Gizmo, allowing you to perform rotations in addition to translations. The rotation ring can be grabbed and drag to rotate the object around that axis.
