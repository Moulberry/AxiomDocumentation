# Introduction

Welcome to the Axiom Documentation, the introductory book about the all-in-one tool for editing Minecraft worlds. The goal of Axiom is to help you build terrain, organics, and structures faster and of a higher quality. The mod brings innovative new tools and algorithms, while also improving ergonomics by improving the feedback loop through real-time client-side visualizations. 

## Who Axiom Is For

Axiom is easy to learn yet hard to master, catering to Minecraft builders of all skill levels through various levels of complexity. The most beginner-friendly tools are found in the [Builder Mode](builder/intro.md), while the [Editor Mode](editor/intro.md) features more in-depth tools which can be combined with [Tool Masks](editor/windows/toolmasks.md) for further complexity.

## Getting Started

Upon creating a new creative world, you should see a 10th hotbar slot containing an icon. If you don't see this, use the `/whynoaxiom` command in-game and follow the provided instructions. If the issue still persists, ask for help in the official [Axiom Discord](https://discord.gg/axiomtool).

- To access the [Builder Tools](builder/buildertools/intro.md) menu, hold Left Alt while the 10th hotbar slot is selected and use the scroll wheel to navigate the options.

- To open the [Context Menu](contextmenu/intro.md), hold the Left Alt key with a hotbar slot from 0 to 9 selected.

- To open/close the [Editor Mode](editor/intro.md), press Right Shift.

These keybinds can be adjusted in Minecraft's [Controls Menu](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Options#Controls).
