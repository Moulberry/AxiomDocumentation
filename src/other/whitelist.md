# Whitelist

Axiom Multiplayer Support on private servers is primarily a feature of the [Commercial License](/other/commerciallicense.md).
However, if Axiom is used for **NON-COMMERCIAL** purposes only, a whitelist can be requested to gain multiplayer access for 90 days or 180 days for Patrons or Discord Server Booster.

After a whitelist expires it can be renewed.
Users may also request on behalf of others, as long as the information provided is true.

Whitelists are a trust-based system to ensure that people using Axiom for commercial purposes buy the [Commercial License](/other/commerciallicense.md) making full-time development possible while providing Axiom for free to users who aren't using Axiom for commercial purposes. Trying to exploit this system will result in a ban from requesting whitelists. If malicious intent isn't directly apparent or the provided information is indecisive, the user will be warned and eventually banned from requesting whitelists.

Some servers, like [Builder's Refuge](https://www.buildersrefuge.com/) or [The Bakery](https://www.bakery.builders/) have a server whitelist, making it possible for everyone to use Axiom without needing a whitelist.

>Note: An automatic 30d multiplayer whitelist is given the first time using Axiom on a server.

## Commercial Use

If you are making money from your work using Axiom, a [Commercial License](/other/commerciallicense.md) is required.

Commercial use includes, but is not limited to:
- Freelance builders using Axiom for commissions
- Build teams working for Marketplace teams
- Monetized servers using builds made with Axiom, including those in development, not yet profitable or not released to the public
- Any similar use where Axiom is being used to make money

### **What doesn't qualify as commercial use?**
You may request free multiplayer support by applying for a Whitelist if you meet the following criteria.
- Creating builds for personal use (eg. to recreate in survival, for your own enjoyment, etc.)
- Creating video/stream content (YouTube, Twitch, TikTok)
- Making free-to-play maps for Realms or PlanetMinecraft

If your specific situation is not mentioned here, please make a post describing it in the `#support` channel on the official [Axiom Discord](https://discord.gg/axiomtool) and wait for **__Team Members__** or **__Staff__** to answer.

## Requesting a Whitelist
On the official [Axiom Discord](https://discord.gg/axiomtool) use the `/requestwhitelist` command in the `#bot-commands` channel to request a whitelist. The command expects a [UUID](https://minecraft.wiki/w/UUID) as input. 

To get your UUID, you can use [NameMC](https://namemc.com/) or use the `/minecraft uuid` command in `#bot-commands`.

After executing the /requestwhitelist command and the UUID isn't whitelisted you will be asked by the Axiom Discord Bot if you are using Axiom for commercial purposes.

Once answered, a pop-up will prompt you to provide information regarding your use of Axiom. If you have questions regarding your privacy, please refer to the [Privacy Policy](https://axiom.moulberry.com/privacy). 

Upon submitting the request Axiom Staff will manually review the request within 24 hours.
