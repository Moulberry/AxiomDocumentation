## Axiom Assets

The [Axiom Asset Website](https://axiomassets.net) was made by Willatronix and aims to make sharing, browsing, and downloading assets for Axiom easy. So far you can browse blueprints, scripts, presets, themes, and asset packs. 
> Note: The website is still in development and certain features might be changed or added in the future.

## Axiom Discord

The official [Axiom Discord](https://discord.gg/axiomtool) provides channels for you to draw inspiration from, download assets, or ask Axiom- and building-related questions.

The `#resources` channel provides many resources such as blueprints, heightmaps, and guides.

The `#showcase` and `#highlights` channels can be used to draw inspiration from for your next build.

The `#building-advice` channel can be used to get advice from the community.

The `#support` channel can be used to get help with Axiom, crashes, issues, or general Axiom-related questions.
