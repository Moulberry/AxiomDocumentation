# Move

The move tool allows you to adjust the position of blocks and entities in a cuboid region

## Selecting a region

To select the region, start by pressing Left Click and then Right Click
If you need to select a non-cuboid shape, you can use Middle Click to extend the selection to that point

See below for a step-by-step demonstration. The initial selection is made with a Left & Right click, which is then further refined to include the whole tree using 3 Middle Clicks

## Moving blocks

Once you have a selection, simply start scrolling to nudge the blocks in the direction you are looking

The blocks can be flipped using Ctrl+F, and rotated using Ctrl+R

To confirm the movement, press Right Click

To undo/redo the action, use Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y
