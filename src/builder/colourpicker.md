# Colour Picker

The Colour Picker is tool to find blocks of similar colour, get the colour of blocks, or find blocks by [hexadecimal colour codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors).

## Options

The **Full Cube** (F) option ensures that only **1x1x1** blocks are displayed in the similar block section.

The **Solid** (S) option ensures that only **collidable** blocks are displayed in the similar block section.

The **Opaque** (O) option ensures that **no transparent** blocks are displayed in the similar block section.

The **Same Texture** (T) option ensures that only blocks with uniform textures are displayed in the similar block section.

The **Eye Dropper** slot near the middle of the screen can be used to drag items onto it to get their average colour. 

A **Hex Code** can be entered into the text field in the bottom-right to get blocks with a similar colour.

The various **RGB** and **HSB** sliders can be used to fine-tune the colour that will be used to suggest blocks in the similar blocks section to the left.

>Note that blocks with properties thought to be filtered by the 'FSOT' options can still appear in the similar block section since mod creators and Mojang need to register the items correctly or in a logical manner.
