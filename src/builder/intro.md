# Builder Mode
The Builder Mode is an enhancement of the vanilla Creative mode. It adds several new features that take a lot of the pain away from traditional building and make everything just a bit easier.


## Builder Context Menu
Many features for builder mode can be toggled or accessed through the Context Menu. The menu can be opened by holding down Left Alt. See [Context Menu](/builder/contextmenu.md) for more information.

## Builder Tools
To the right of the hotbar, you can find the Builder Tools. These tools are very simple and are intended to ease structural/small scale building where use of the more powerful [Editor Mode](/editor/intro.md) is too unwieldly.

To start using a Builder Tool, scroll to the 10th slot or press 0.
To switch to a different Builder Tool, hold Left Alt and then scroll.

The three main keybinds for the Builder Tools are left-click, right-click and middle-click. Middle-click has similar a functionality to left and right-click but instead of selecting the corners, middle-click is used to select the faces. 

When working with a selection, useful information such as offset and size is displayed above the hotbar.

Holding either x, y or z while scrolling to move the placement will lock it to that direction.

The tools that are currently available in this section are:
- [Move](/builder/move.md)
- [Clone](/builder/clone.md)
- [Stack](/builder/stack.md)
- [Smear](/builder/smear.md)
- [Extrude](/builder/extrude.md)
- [Erase](/builder/erase.md)
- [Setup Symmetry](/builder/setupsymmetry.md)
