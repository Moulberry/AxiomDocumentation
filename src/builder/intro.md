# Builder Mode

**Builder Mode** is a much enhanced version of Minecraft's vanilla creative mode. It adds many new features that take a lot of the pain away from traditional building and make everything just a bit easier.

Many features for builder mode can be toggled or accessed through the **[Context Menu](/contextmenu/intro.md)**. Open the Context Menu by holding down **Left Alt** while your currently selected slot is 0 - 9 (any but the Axiom slot).

## Builder Tools

To the right of the hotbar is where you find the **Builder Tools**. These tools are very simple and are intended to ease structural/small scale building where use of the more powerful [Editor Mode](/editor/intro.md) is too unwieldy.

To start using a Builder Tool, scroll to the 10th slot or press 0.
To switch to a different Builder Tool, hold Left Alt and then scroll.

The three main keybinds for the Builder Tools are **left-click, right-click** and **middle-click**. 

**Middle-click** has similar a functionality to left and right-click but instead of selecting the corners, middle-click is used to select the faces. 

When working with a selection, useful information such as *offset* and *size* is displayed above the hotbar.

## Gameplay

Using **Ctrl + C** while looking at a block will copy its exact nbt state.

When searching in the creative inventory, pressing **enter** will add the first listed block to your current hotbar slot.
