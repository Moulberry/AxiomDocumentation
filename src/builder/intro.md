# Builder Mode

The Builder Mode is an enhancement of the vanilla Creative mode. It adds several new features that take a lot of the pain away from traditional building and make everything just a bit easier.

## Builder Context Menu

Many features for builder mode can be toggled or accessed through the Context Menu. The menu can be opened by holding down Left Alt. See [Context Menu](/contextmenu/intro.md) for more information.

## Builder Tools

To the right of the hotbar, you can find the Builder Tools. These tools are very simple and are intended to ease structural/small scale building where use of the more powerful [Editor Mode](/editor/intro.md) is too unwieldy.

To start using a Builder Tool, scroll to the 10th slot or press 0.
To switch to a different Builder Tool, hold Left Alt and then scroll.

The three main keybinds for the Builder Tools are left-click, right-click and middle-click. Middle-click has similar a functionality to left and right-click but instead of selecting the corners, middle-click is used to select the faces. 

When working with a selection, useful information such as offset and size is displayed above the hotbar.

## Gameplay

Using Ctrl + C while looking at a block will copy its exact nbt state.

When searching in the creative inventory, pressing enter will add the first listed block to your current hotbar slot.
