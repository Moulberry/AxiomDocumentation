# Text

The **Text** tool lets the user write text with any True Type Font or .ttf file font in the world. It can be configured to have a smaller or larger font scale

Just write the text desired into the ‘Text’ field and right-click to place it in the world with a gizmo.

> Note: As of Axiom-b0.97, the text tool is unfinished and provided for demonstration purposes only. Thank you for your understanding
