# Force Place

The **Force Place** capability bypasses normal placement restrictions.

- Blocks which normally need to be attached to solid blocks can be placed in mid air
- Blocks can be placed inside entities (including yourself)
- Plant blocks no longer need to be placed on farmland
- Blocks can be placed regardless of light level
- And much more!

> Tip: Force Place is best used in combination with [No Updates](noupdates.md) in order to ensure illegally placed blocks don't break when updated. You may also need to disable random updates with /gamerule randomTickSpeed 0.
